# JavaScript mini apps (2022)

This website contain mini apps created only with JavaScript with the knowledge from the Web Development course. They are homeworks and workshops we study at the course. I improved and add something extra to each of them to cover everything I learned about HTML, CSS, Control Structures, Dom manipulation, Functions and Scopes, AJAX, OOP, ES 6, BOM, etc.

The website contains 6 mini-projects:

1. Todo list
   You can add, delete, edit and check the todos. All data are saved in localStorage.

2. Phone Book
   You can add, update, delete, and view contacts (full CRUD functionality).
   Data is saved on my personal Heroku server.
   ⚠️ Since Heroku is no longer free, the server may be unavailable if my subscription is inactive.

3. Weather App
   Displays current weather information for any city using a public weather API.
   ⚠️ Since Heroku is no longer free, the server may be unavailable if my subscription is inactive.

4. Rock Paper Scissors
   A simple game against the computer with score tracking.

5. Race Game
   A mini-game where you control a car and avoid obstacles to reach the finish line.

6. Quiz Game
   Multiple-choice questions about dog breeds with score calculation at the end of the quiz.
