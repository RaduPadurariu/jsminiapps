This website contain mini apps created only with Java Script with the knowledge from the Web Development course. They are homeworks and workshops we study at the course. I improved and add something extra to each of them to cover everything I learned about HTML, CSS, Control Structures, Dom manipulation, Functions and Scopes, AJAX, OOP, ES 6, BOM, etc.
